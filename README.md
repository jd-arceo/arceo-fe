## Arceo JavaScript Test

### Prerequisites
* NodeJS 10.x or later (OR can be run in Repl.it)

### Instructions to run
EventEmitter.js is required in the tests. Do not modify tests except for commenting and uncommenting tests to run.
Code can be tested with `node EventEmitter.test.js`

### Requirements
Implement an EventEmitter that can pass the tests. If you'd like to Google documentation, you can. If you'd like to import any dependencies, you can. However, the tests can be passed with modern vanilla JavaScript without any dependencies.
